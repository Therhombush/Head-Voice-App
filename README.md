## What is HeadVoice?
HeadVoice allows those with conditions such as MS, stroke, ALS, or spinal cord injuries to communicate using an app that tracks head movements, without the need to spend tens of thousands of dollars on technology to do so.

## Features

### Multimodal User Interface

HeadVoice uses ARCore to track the user's head movements and understand where the user is looking at on the screen. This allows the app to be used completely hands-free: users can look around the screen and make selections by lingering their gaze at a particular element. 

For users with more mobility, the app can be operated by touch.
